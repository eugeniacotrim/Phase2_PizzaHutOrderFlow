# simplilearnPhase2Project1
I have automated testing of the Pizza Hut Order flow using Selenium and Cucumber (Scenario 1), and using TestNG with a Maven project (Scenario 2).
Probably due to my current location being outside of India, I had some issues selecting the location provided in the project description (Lulu Mall Bangalore),
since the website would repeatedly state that that location was not available for online orders. Therefore, I selected an alternative location instead
(Delhi Express Aerocity). Please find screenshots attached in this git repository for reference.

For the final step of Scenario 1, I did not get the expected pop up for a minimum order required, and so the step failed and so did my test.

For Scenario 2, I created an excel worksheet to draw the url from. Please find this excel worksheet (PizzaHut001URL.xlsx) attached in this git repository.

I created extent reports for both scenarios and they are available as .html files. Please find reports attached in this git repository for reference.
